# ML4CompHeatTransfer
repo for the ML for composite heat transfer project

## Three components
- Visualize the weight with affine model:  SVM, Logistic Regression 
  The advantage of linear affine model is to link the weight directly to the physical geometry.
  
- Improve Accuracy with CNN
  CNN has strong pattern recognition capabilities. A naive CNN has already reached good robustness.
  
- Generate composite design
  A baseline generative model has been proposed through selecting th top candidate from the
  GAN should be considered for future improvements
