# ML4CompHeatTransfer
Repo for the ML for composite heat transfer project
only part 2 is uploaded  
The notebook is hosted on google colab and Git is only used for presentation

## Contents
- Batch FEM heat transfer simulation of random 2D geometries through Matlab

- Visualize the weight with linear affine model:  SVM, Logistic Regression   (completed)
  The advantage of linear affine model is to link the weight directly to the physical geometry.
  
- Improve Accuracy with CNN (updated)   
  CNN has strong pattern recognition capabilities. A naive CNN has already reached good robustness. Activation and the weights of the CNN filter has been developed to show the physics-awareness of the network. Stil in progress.
  
- Generate composite design  (future)
  A baseline generative model has been proposed through selecting th top candidate from the predictions
  In the future, GAN should be considered
