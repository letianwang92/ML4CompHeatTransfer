# ML4CompHeatTransfer
repo for the ML for composite heat transfer project
only part 2 is uploaded

## Three components
- Visualize the weight with affine model:  SVM, Logistic Regression 
  The advantage of linear affine model is to link the weight directly to the physical geometry.
  
- Improve Accuracy with CNN (updated)
  CNN has strong pattern recognition capabilities. A naive CNN has already reached good robustness.
  
- Generate composite design
  A baseline generative model has been proposed through selecting th top candidate from the predictions
  In the future, GAN should be considered
